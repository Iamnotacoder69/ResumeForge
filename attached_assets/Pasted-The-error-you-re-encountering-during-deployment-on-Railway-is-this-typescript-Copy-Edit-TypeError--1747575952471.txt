The error you're encountering during deployment on Railway is this:

typescript
Copy
Edit
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
This means somewhere in your code or dependencies, a path.resolve(...) or similar method is being called, but the argument is undefined.

✅ Root Cause
This error is usually caused by:

Trying to resolve a path using a variable that is undefined (e.g. resolve(process.env.FILE_PATH) when FILE_PATH is not set).

Using __dirname or __filename incorrectly in ES modules (type: "module" in your package.json).

A missing asset or file that Puppeteer expects but can't find.

And it points specifically to this line:

js
Copy
Edit
at file:///app/dist/index.js:1903:18
✅ Solution Steps
1. Check the code at line 1903 in dist/index.js
This is where the issue is triggered. Look at what's being passed into path.resolve(...) or similar.

If this is compiled code, trace back to the original line in your source file (like src/index.js) to understand which variable is undefined.

2. Check for Missing Environment Variables
If you're using process.env.SOME_VAR to build a path, make sure it's defined in Railway:

Go to your Railway project.

Click Settings → Variables.

Ensure all environment variables your code needs are listed and correctly set.

3. Puppeteer & Assets
If you’re using Puppeteer to render a page (e.g. generate a PDF or screenshot), and you're referencing a local file (like an HTML or template), make sure that file is included in the deployment and the path to it is correct.

In ES Modules, you cannot use __dirname directly. Use this instead:

js
Copy
Edit
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname, resolve } from 'path';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

const htmlPath = resolve(__dirname, 'template.html');
4. Check Build Output
If you're compiling from TypeScript or bundling with a tool like Webpack, ensure the build process includes all necessary files, including templates and static assets. Railway runs the app in /app/dist/ — make sure your files are in there after build.
